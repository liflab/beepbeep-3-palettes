<p>Palettes are modular extensions to
<a href="https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3">BeepBeep 3</a>, an event stream
processing library. Each palette depends on BeepBeep's core library, which must
be built or downloaded beforehand.</p>

<p>Even though all palettes are presented under a single documentation tree,
most of them are independent and can be used in isolation. As a matter of
fact, palettes are in varying states of development and documentation.</p>
