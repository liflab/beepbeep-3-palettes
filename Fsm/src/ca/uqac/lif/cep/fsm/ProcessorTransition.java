/**
 * Represents a transition in the Moore machine.  
 * Using this transition actually creates a generalized Moore machine, as
 * the labels on each
 * transition are themselves <em>processors</em>: not only can they express
 * complex conditions on the input event, but they can also have a
 * state. This was done mainly because it was handy to just use the class
 * <code>Processor</code> to evaluate conditions (send the event to the processor
 * and just collect its output), rather than come up with special objects to
 * do that.
 * <p>
 * A "classical" Moore machine is a particular case where all processors
 * for expressing the conditions are unary and stateless.
